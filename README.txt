The game:
You are in control of a space ship which can apply thrust downward. You can control the ship with WASD or the arrow keys.
##1st Press V to show the ship (may take a few trys due to button bounce)
Up or W: use booster rockets
Left, Right or A, D: turn the ship left or right respectively
changing the ships angle changes its motion, the thrusters apply a force which controls acceleration only
Velocity and position follow.
The ship cannot move through the floor, can continue through either right or left, and goes indefinitely upward

Gravity, the ball and the spaceship are both affected by gravity
the strength of the gravity can be changed by pressing the 0, or 1-6 buttons

If the ship and ball collide, the ball will loose all velocity in both axis
